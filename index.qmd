I am currently working in Software Engineering 👨‍💻 for Data, AI and Cloud at [qdive][1].\
I am also the founder & CEO of [byteCare][2].\
I usually write Python 🐍 and work with AWS and Azure ☁️.\
On the side I also mix in some TypeScript, Go and Terraform.\
If not coding, I might hit the homegym 🏋️‍♂️, go for a hike 🥾 or do some cooking 👨‍🍳.
