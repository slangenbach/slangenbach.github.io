# Hello, world!

You may ask yourself: Why on earth would someone start their own blog in 2020? After all, there are these fancy shiny social media platforms now, so why bother with creating content via an oldschool blog?

To me, the very existence of social media plattforms is a strong motivation to start blogging: Instead of wasting time on social media, [becoming ever more miserable](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/12/13/social-medias-shift-toward-misery/), creating posts that either nobody reads or which won't show up in the newsfeed of the intendend audience anyway, I took action: I deleted all my social media accounts and decided to go for it. From today onwards, I will share lessons learned from doing **data engieering** and **machine learning** in the corporate world.

I hope that the content posted here will be interesting and helpful to my readers. 

P.S.: If you want to start blogging too, but do not know how, have a look at [fastai's article series on blogging](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/20/blog_overview/) - it really makes blogging easy.
