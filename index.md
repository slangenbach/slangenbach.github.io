# Stefan Langenbach


I am a problem-solver at heart, working in Software Engineering for
Data, AI and cloud at [qdive](https://www.qdive.io/). I am also the
founder & CEO of [byteCare](https://www.bytecare.tech). I usually write
Python and work with AWS and Azure. On the side I also mix in some
TypeScript, Go and Terraform. If not coding, I might hit the home gym,
go for a hike or do some cooking
