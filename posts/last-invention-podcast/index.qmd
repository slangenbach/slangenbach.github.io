I stumbled upon a gem last week: [The Last Invention][1] from [Longview][2] is a podcast series about the origins, development, risks and opportunities posed by AI. Starting with the [Turing test][3] in the 1950s, it goes on to tell the story of AI development, mentioning [DeepBlue][4], [Watson][5], [AlphaGo][6], [Deepmind][7], [OpenAI][8] and [Anthropic][9]. During the last week, I listened to the entire first season and can only recommend it: It's thought-provoking, very well produced and just fascinating.
