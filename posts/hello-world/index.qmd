Dear reader,

welcome to my blog.\
This is my second? attempt at publishing content regularly. The plan is to use this blog to document the things I learned ([TIL][1]). As I have a life outside work, I won't do so on daily basis. Instead, my goal is create one post per month featuring the most important learnings. I promise that no AI will be used to generate the text you will read. This is an exercise in writing, not AI engineering.

Looking forward to join me on this journey.
